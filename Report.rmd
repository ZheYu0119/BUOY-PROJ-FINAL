## Introduction

In this buoy project we aim to find whether there is a evidence of global warming, so we intended to use the data in National Data Buoy Center from 1987 to 2016 to see if there are upward trends with air temperature and water temperature as time goes by. We have three steps:
* Import and clean data
* Transform data and make analysis
* Draw a conclusion

## Import and clean data

At first, we have to import the data from the website. Because there are some differences in some years so I separated the 20 years into three parts, making them all have 16 variables. And then combine all the data into one data frame.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#get each data frame from 1987 to 2016
url1 <- "http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/view_text_file.php?filename=mlrf1h"
url2 <- ".txt.gz&dir=data/historical/stdmet/"
years <- c(1987:2016)
urls <- str_c(url1, years, url2, sep ="")
filenames <- str_c("mr", years, sep = "")
N <- length(urls)

for (i in 1:N){
  suppressMessages(
    assign(filenames[i], read.table(urls[i], header = TRUE,fill = T))
  )
  file <- get(filenames[i])
}

# add 19 in front of year
for (i in 1:12){
  file <- get(filenames[i])
  file$YY <- file$YY + 1900
  assign(filenames[i],file)
}

#throw out the last column
for (i in 14:18){
  file <- get(filenames[i])
  assign(filenames[i],file[,1:16])
}

#throw out the "mm" column and the last column
for (i in 19:30){
  file <- get(filenames[i])
  assign(filenames[i],file[,c(1:4,6:17)])
}

#combine all the data frame and unify the column name
for (i in 1:30){
  file <- get(filenames[i])
  colnames(file) <- c("YYYY", "MM", "DD", "hh", "WD", "WSPD", "GST", "WVHT", "DPD", "APD", "MWD", "BAR", "ATMP", "WTMP", "DEWP", "VIS")
  
  if(i==1){
    MR <- file
  }
  else{
    MR <- rbind.data.frame(MR, file)
  }
}
```

Then I got the data frame MR.csv

```{r echo = FALSE}
print(MR)
```

Secondly, I noticed that there are some errors in column ATMP and WTMP, so I throw out all the rows which ATMP and WTMP are larger than 100.And then transfer the date and time into posix numbers.

```{r}
#select columns that are not 99, 999
MR <- MR[,c(1:7,12:14)]

#filter rows that ATMP and WTMP are larger than 100
MR <- filter(MR,MR$ATMP<100&MR$WTMP<100)

#combine all the time into one column using lubridate package
MR_DATE <- MR %>%
  mutate(DATETIME = make_datetime(YYYY,MM,DD,hh))

#change the order of each column, put the time into first place.
MR_DATE <- MR_DATE[,5:11]
cols <- colnames(MR_DATE)
new_cols <- c(cols[7],cols[1:6])
MR_DATE <- MR_DATE[,new_cols]

```

Then I got the MR_DATE.csv

```{R echo=FALSE}
print(MR_DATE)
```

## Transform data and make analysis

Firstly, I choose the data at 12:00:00 each day and become a new data frame.

```{r}
MR_DAY <- filter(MR,MR$hh==12)
MR_DAY <- MR_DAY %>%
  mutate(DATETIME = make_datetime(YYYY,MM,DD,hh))
```
```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_point(aes(MR_DAY$DATETIME,MR_DAY$ATMP),alpha=0.2)+
  geom_smooth(method=lm,aes(MR_DAY$DATETIME,MR_DAY$ATMP))+
  geom_abline(intercept = 24.6,slope = 0,color="red")+
  labs(title="Air Temperature vs Time",x="Time",y="Air Temperature")

ggplot(data=)+
  geom_point(aes(MR_DAY$DATETIME,MR_DAY$WTMP),alpha=0.2)+
  geom_smooth(method=lm,aes(MR_DAY$DATETIME,MR_DAY$WTMP))+
  geom_abline(intercept = 26.35,slope = 0,color="red")+
  labs(title="Water Temperature vs Time",x="Time",y="Water Temperature")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
